# NYTSentiment
A simple Python program for analyzing the sentiment of NYT article headlines.

## Running
You'll need to add a valid New York Times Search API key. One can be acquired easily and for free [here](https://developer.nytimes.com/signup).

Once you've obtained your key, insert it into the environment variable `$NYTKEY` of your shell:

```sh
export NYTKEY=yourkeyhere
```
